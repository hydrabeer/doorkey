## Principles of Universal Design
### Principle 1: Equitable Use

Adherence:
- Our program uses a high contrast colour theme ensuring text clarity
- Our text is a readable size with sufficient spacing and large buttons

Future improvements:
- Adding tooltips or labels to buttons for better accessibility
- Allow navigation by keyboard only (by using keys like Tab)

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

Adherence:
- Users can choose between their own password or a secure random password generator
- Users have the ability to import from other browsers or password managers
- Users can choose between saving the vault locally or sync to the cloud

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

Adherence:
- Our UI is minimal and uncluttered with clear text labels and buttons
- The user is guided through an intuitive flow through various views
- We use icons (such as the clipboard icon) to indicate functions like copy to clipboard

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information

Adherence:
- Error messages are displayed consistently (due to reusing DoorkeyForm) and in a red colour
- All views have a title that clearly indicates the purpose of the view (for example, "Create Vault Item")

Future improvements:
- Adding text-to-speech alerts for errors like "Invalid password" can help with accessibility

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

Adherence:
- Deleting vault items such as passwords requires a second confirmation to ensure no accidental deletion
- Our password strength indicator ensures that users can only add sufficiently secure passwords
- The phishing detection feature notifies users if their credentials were found to be on a malicious URL
- Upon copying a password, the clipboard is automatically cleared after a while to ensure it doesn't remain in clipboard

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

Adherence:
- The copy button allows for easy coping of usernames and passwords to the clipboard in one click
- The link button opens the URL of the password item so the user doesn't have to navigate to it manually
- The search bar allows for easy and quick filtering of items to find what you want

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

Adherence:
- Our window's default size is small enough to display in full on any screen; it is also a responsive layout
- The software is written in Java and is easily run on any desktop OS due to .jar being a cross-platform format

Future improvements:
- Add support for mobile operating systems like Android and iOS
