# Accessibility Report
## Principles of Universal Design
### Principle 1: Equitable Use

Adherence:
- Our program uses a high contrast colour theme ensuring text clarity
- Our text is a readable size with sufficient spacing and large buttons

Future improvements:
- Adding tooltips or labels to buttons for better accessibility
- Allow navigation by keyboard only (by using keys like Tab)

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

Adherence:
- Users can choose between their own password or a secure random password generator
- Users have the ability to import from other browsers or password managers
- Users can choose between saving the vault locally or sync to the cloud

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

Adherence:
- Our UI is minimal and uncluttered with clear text labels and buttons
- The user is guided through an intuitive flow through various views
- We use icons (such as the clipboard icon) to indicate functions like copy to clipboard

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information

Adherence:
- Error messages are displayed consistently (due to reusing DoorkeyForm) and in a red colour
- All views have a title that clearly indicates the purpose of the view (for example, "Create Vault Item")

Future improvements:
- Adding text-to-speech alerts for errors like "Invalid password" can help with accessibility

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

Adherence:
- Deleting vault items such as passwords requires a second confirmation to ensure no accidental deletion
- Our password strength indicator ensures that users can only add sufficiently secure passwords
- The phishing detection feature notifies users if their credentials were found to be on a malicious URL
- Upon copying a password, the clipboard is automatically cleared after a while to ensure it doesn't remain in clipboard

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

Adherence:
- The copy button allows for easy coping of usernames and passwords to the clipboard in one click
- The link button opens the URL of the password item so the user doesn't have to navigate to it manually
- The search bar allows for easy and quick filtering of items to find what you want

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

Adherence:
- Our window's default size is small enough to display in full on any screen; it is also a responsive layout
- The software is written in Java and is easily run on any desktop OS due to .jar being a cross-platform format

Future improvements:
- Add support for mobile operating systems like Android and iOS

## Demographics Who Are Less Likely to Use the Program
- DoorKey is less likely to be used by individuals who are part of the older demographic and visually impaired 
individuals. Although DoorKey does much to adhere to the Universal Principles of design there are a few reason why 
older individuals and visually impaired individuals might be less likely to choose DoorKey. Since DoorKey does not offer
family features like some other password manager, younger family members are less likely to recommend DoorKey to their 
older family members. Additionally, since older individuals might be weary about giving their information to DoorKey,
and they are less likely to be recommended by a family member they might be less likely to use DoorKey. DoorKey has a
few accessibility concerns that relate to visually impaired and older individuals. Many of the buttons use symbols to 
indicate their feature instead of text. Although these symbols are universally synonymous with their associated 
features, older individuals who do not use technology as frequently might be unfamiliar. In addition, visually impaired
individuals might struggle to read and identify these symbols due to DoorKey not offering an enlarged version of the 
software or zoom in features. Finally, a lack of text to speech feature might also pose an issue for some individuals.
